        In this study we investigated whether individuals cooperate more with other individuals that are socially close to them compared to those that are socially distant to them. We also wanted to investigate whether it plays a role, if the interaction partner is part of the same or a different group. For any questions, feel free to contact the researcher Vanessa Clemens vanessa.clemens@uni-koeln.de.<br><br>
        Any rewards and bonuses will be credited in your account through Prolific within one month (maximum) after the study. <br><br>
        Thanks again for participating, and have a nice day! <br><br>
