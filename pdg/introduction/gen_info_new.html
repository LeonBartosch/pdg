    <p>
        Dear Participant,
        Thank you for your interest in our study "Cooperation with others"!<br><br>
        <b>About this study <br><br></b>
        In this study, you will be asked to complete decision-making tasks and provide demographic information. Specifically, we are interested in how people make decisions that benefit themselves and others. The study takes about 10 minutes.<br><br>
        Participation is only possible if you are 18 years or older and is completely voluntary. Refusal to take part in the study involves no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. We ask you to complete this study conscientiously and in one go. If for personal reasons you cannot finish the task, you can stop the study, without the need to justify, by closing the browser window. This will not affect your approval rate on Prolific, you will be welcome to participate in our future studies, and you will receive partial compensation proportional to your progress on the experiment. Thank you very much for your cooperation!<br><br>
         <b>Compensation <br><br></b>
        For completing this online study, you will receive a basic payment of £1,50. Additionally, you can receive a bonus payment (maximum of £1). The bonus you earn is based on chance, your own and others’ roles and decisions during the study. You will receive more detailed information about the calculation of the bonus during the study. Rewards and extra bonuses will be credited in your account through Prolific within one month (maximum) after the entire study is completed. In case of an early termination of the study, we kindly ask you to send us a screenshot of the last part you completed and we will refund you a partial amount, i.e., if you decide to leave the study after half of the total duration, you will receive 50% of the basic amount.<br><br>
        <b>Basic information on data protection<br><br></b>
        Collected data contains the responses given in the survey and your Prolific ID. At no point, you will be asked for your name or e-mail address. No additional personal data such as IP address or location code will be collected. All personal data will be treated as strictly confidential.<br><br>
        Data will be collected using oTree which runs on a server at University of Cologne (Germany) and then securely downloaded and stored on work computers at the University of Cologne. These computers are equipped with advanced security measures, including encryption, to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data. Data transfer from oTree to our systems is encrypted and secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS), commonly known as HTTPS.<br><br>
        Until your data has been anonymized (i.e., when your Prolific ID is removed from the data), you have the right to access, objection, portability, erasure, restriction of processing and rectification concerning your data. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact the investigator (see below) and provide your prolific ID. Revocation of consent to data processing does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on this consent before its revocation. The data will be completely anonymized 12 weeks after completion of the study (~end of March 2025) by removing your Prolific ID (~end of June 2025).<br><br>
        After anonymization, your data cannot be attributed to your person anymore and we cannot comply with such requests anymore.
        Your data will be analyzed in anonymized form and results of this study will be published in anonymized form. To allow scientific transparency, anonymized data may be shared with other researchers for further analysis and may be made available for reuse as open data in a data repository on the Internet (Open Science Framework, www.osf.io). Thus, this study follows the recommendations of the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the German Society for Psychology (DGPs) for quality control in research. Purpose, type and extent of this reuse are not yet foreseeable. If you are interested in the results of this study, you may contact the investigator (see below). Note that information on your individual results cannot be given after data has been anonymized.<br><br>
        In case you have questions on this declaration of data protection, please contact the principal investigator (in case of special questions regarding the data protection of this study) or the data protection officer (in case of general questions regarding data protection; responsible for policy matters). According to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the respective national data protection laws and other regulations, responsible is the University of Cologne or the leading researcher, Vanessa Clemens (vanessa.clemens@uni-koeln.de).<br><br>
