    You have to consent to the terms of participation to take part in the study. <br><br>
    Declaration of consent I hereby confirm that I am participating in this study on a voluntary basis. I confirm that I am at least 18 years old. I am aware that I can quit the study at any time without indicating any reasons (by closing my browser window) and without negative consequences. I am aware that in case of early survey termination, I will only be compensated proportionally. After completion of the study, I have the right to be informed about the background, aims and results of the study. I am aware that I can assert this right by asking the principal investigator Vanessa Clemens (vanessa.clemens@uni-koeln.de) for the relevant information. The corresponding contact address will be indicated at the end of the study.<br><br>
    My anonymity towards third parties will remain assured at all times. The Prolific ID is only accessible by the principal investigators in order to transact the payment and to delete my data if requested. Data will be used for scientific purposes only and will be saved only for data analysis. Conclusions regarding individual participants are not possible. After the submission, my anonymized data will be made available on OSF for secondary use by third parties in order to ensure transparency in science. The aim, purpose and extent of this secondary use are not yet foreseeable but will be used for scientific purposes only. <br><br>
    I am aware that the principal investigator is not responsible for the content of third parties (e.g., web-sites) linked to, nor for the possible transfer of data (e.g., by using cookies) that may be involved. <br><br>
    I am aware that I can download the introductory participant information as well as this consent form here. [OSF Link will be added] <br><br>
    I have read and understood the above-mentioned points and consent to the terms of participation.<br><br>
