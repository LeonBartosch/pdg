    <p>In this task, you are a member of the <b>{{ player.participant.color }}</b> group. You will interact with different participants who are also taking part in this study. These participants differ in two ways:
        <ul>
            <li>How <b>socially close</b> or <b>socially distant</b> they are to you.</li>
            <li>Whether they belong to the <b>same group</b> as yours ({{ player.participant.color }}) or the <b>other group</b> ({{ other_color }}).</li>
        </ul><br>
        <img style="width:75%" src="{{ static image_path }}"/><br>
        All of the choices you will make are anonymous, so neither your own nor the other participantâ€™s identities are disclosed at any point.
