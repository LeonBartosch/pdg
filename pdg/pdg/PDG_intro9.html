        <b>NOTE, your estimation may determine your bonus payment.</b>
        <br><br>
        In this case, if your estimation is correct, you will receive <b>400 bonus Talers.</b><br>
        If it is incorrect, you will receive <b>200 Talers minus</b> how much your estimate deviates from Person B’s actual behavior.
        <br><br>
        <b>For example: </b><br>
        If you estimate that Person B transfers 100 bonus Talers to you but Person B transferred 80 Talers to you, you will receive 180 bonus Talers.<br><br>
        Calculation:<br>
        200 – 20 (Estimation error) = 180 bonus Talers
