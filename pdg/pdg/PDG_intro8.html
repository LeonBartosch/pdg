        <b>NOTE, what you transfer to Person B and what Person B transfers to you will determine your bonus payment. </b>
        <br><br>
        Specifically, your bonus payment will be calculated in the following way: <br><br>
        <b>Bonus payment = 5 Talers</b> (your initial endowment) <b>minus</b> the amount you transferred to Person B <b>plus</b> twice the amount Person B transferred to you.<br><br>

        <b>For example:</b> <br><br>
        If you transfer 3 Talers to Person B and Person B transfers 2 Talers to you, your bonus will be:<br>
        5 â€“ 3 (transfer to Person B)<br>
        + 2 (transfer from Person B) x 2 <br>
        = 6
