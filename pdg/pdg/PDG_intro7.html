        <b>NOTE, what you transfer to Person B and what Person B transfers to you may determine your bonus payment.</b><br><br>

        In this case, your bonus payment will be calculated in the following way: <b>Bonus payment = 100 Talers</b> (your initial endowment) minus the amount you transferred to Person B <b>plus</b> twice the amount Person B transferred to you.<br><br>

        <b>For example:</b><br>
        If you transfer 50 Talers to Person B and Person B transfers 40 Talers to you, your bonus will be:<br>
        100 â€“ 50 (transfer to Person B) + 40 (transfer from Person B) x 2 = 130
